## Setting Up VS-code and Java

-   Install **Visual Studio Code** (Download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download))
-   Install **JavaJDK** (this will run Java program for you) [I would recommend [OpenJDK11 HotSpot](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)]
-   Add `JAVA_HOME` = `YourDrive:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-xx.x.xx.x-hotspot` (this is relative path and it will depend upon your JavaJDK installation path.
-   Make sure you have got [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) installed to make your life much easier.

Note: This will change and vary as we add more dependencies or libraries in our project.
